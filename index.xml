<p>Hey <strong>Integration</strong>! Rupsa here,</p>
<p>After the massive success of <strong>Band-e-Thlon</strong>, the cultural chapter of <strong>Integration</strong> was ready to grace the stage for its singing competition; <strong>Alaap</strong>.</p>
<p>This year, the prestigious singing competition was truly a celebration of music as we paid tribute to the musical maestro Padma Shri Late <strong>Ustad Rashid Khan</strong>. It was a two-day event filled with beautiful melodies and soulful performances. The Prelims were held on the <em>3rd of February</em> and the Finals on the <em>4th</em>.</p>
<p>Renowned <em>Nazrulgeeti</em> artist <em>Shrimati Monali Mitra Paladhi</em> and <em>Times of India’s</em> best male vocalist for <strong>Kishore Kumar</strong> award recipient <strong>Shri Surankan Bhowmick</strong> had graced the event by being present as judges for the prelims.</p>
<p>We also had the honor to have <strong>Shri Supriya Das Bala</strong>, a known face in social media and television as our percussionist to support our participants.</p>
<p>The event started with a brief speech on <em>Ustad Rashid Khan</em>, his life, works and musical expeditions, followed by a 1-minute silence condoling his tragic demise.</p>
<p>It was finally time for the main event to begin!</p>
<p>One of the most captivating aspects of this event was the sheer diversity of performances. More than 50 enthusiastic participants from various colleges performed solo and duet renditions of songs spanning a variety of genres of classical, and <em>Bollywood</em> songs, <em>Rabindra Sangeet</em>, and <em>Nazrul Geeti</em> and set the stage on fire with their eclectic tastes and talents.</p>
<p>As the performances came to an end, the top 20 performers were selected to compete for the Finals.</p>
<p>On 4th February, the 20 finalists were ready to rock the stage. <strong>Kajal Sengupta</strong>, the honorary secretary of “Sarbabharatiya Sangeet o Sankriti Parishad” and <strong>Snighdadeb Sengupta</strong>, recipient of <em>Radio Mirchi Music Award Bangla</em> best male vocalist 2016, honoured the event with their august presence as judges for the performances of the finalists. The event began with another speech on Late <em>Ustad Rashid Khan</em>’s life, after which began the final performances to achieve the coveted spots in the top five. As the final notes faded into the air, the judges retreated to deliberate, faced with the daunting task of selecting the winners from a pool of exceptional talent. Each participant, regardless of the outcome, was applauded for their talent and dedication. Finally, winners are announced, amidst cheers and applause, a testament to the spirit of camaraderie that defines college fests. <strong>Rishiraj Baul</strong> won the competition with his flawless rendition of Raga Jog. <strong>Ahana Nandy</strong>, <strong>Aishik Bhattacharya</strong>, <strong>Debayani Sinha Ray</strong>, and <strong>Swagnik Sinha Roy</strong> were the other top 5 winners in that order. The winners were awarded cash prizes from a prize pool of Rs 5000 along with rank certificates. All 20 finalists were given finalist certificates.</p>
<p>As this year’s edition of <strong>Alaap</strong> concluded, it left behind a legacy of harmony, resonating in the memories of those who witnessed its magic. It serves as a testament to the power of music to transcend barriers, unite hearts, and create everlasting bonds. I hope you enjoyed reading about this event as much as we enjoyed hosting it. Stay tuned for more exciting <strong>Integration</strong> events in the future!</p>
<p>Au revoir.</p>

<p>Hey <strong>Integration</strong>! Shambo here.</p>
<p><strong>Integration</strong> started off with a bang on the <em>20th of January</em> with the first edition of the <strong>Prof.&nbsp;Saurabh Ghosh Memorial Lecture Series</strong> in <strong>2024</strong>, honoring the legacy of our very own <strong>Sauda</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Saurabh Ghosh</em></strong>, who was popularly known as <strong>Sauda</strong> among students and staff, worked as a professor in the <em>Human Genetics Unit</em> at <em>ISI</em>. He specialized in <strong>General Epidemiology</strong> and was appointed as the <strong>Dean of Studies</strong> of <em>ISI</em> in <em>2022</em>, just a few weeks before his unfortunate demise on <em>October 3rd, 2022</em>. His sudden death left a profound void in the hearts of his students and colleagues. To commemorate his memory, the <strong>Sauda Memorial</strong> lecture series was initiated in <em>2023</em> as a significant part of <em>Integration</em>.</p>
<p>This time around, we were honored to host <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Viswanathan Mohan</strong>, an internationally acclaimed <em>diabetologist</em> and <em>Chairman</em> of the <strong>Madras Diabetes Research Foundation</strong> and <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Mohan’s Diabetes Specialities Centre</strong>, Chennai, as well as the esteemed <em>Dr.&nbsp;Rajiv Bahl</em>, <em>Director General</em> of the <strong>Indian Council of Medical Research</strong>.</p>
<p>This edition of the lecture series started off with a brilliant introduction to the speakers by <strong>Prof.&nbsp;Partha P. Majumdar</strong>, a close colleague of <em>Sauda</em>, who introduced us to his work with both <strong>MDRF</strong> and the <strong>ICMR</strong>.</p>
<p>The first lecture started with a captivating presentation by <strong>Dr.&nbsp;V. Mohan</strong> on what is known as the “<em>diabetes epidemic in India</em>.” <em>Dr.&nbsp;Mohan</em> spent much of his life carrying out foundational research in the field, crafting solutions, and carrying out people-oriented experiments to get to the root of the issue. He had several success stories to present, including the stories of the <em>ASIAD colony</em> and <em>T Nagar</em> in <em>Chennai</em>, as well as the village of <em>Chunampet</em>, all presented in his unique, witty way of storytelling. (Including a little anecdote about how a philanthropic zamindar got involved with the <strong>ISRO</strong>!) The presentation included a unique blend of statistical work and fieldwork, which enchanted the audience.</p>
<p>The second lecture was also unique in its own right, as <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Rajiv Bahl</strong> set the stage with a series of stories surrounding the most interesting outcome of <strong>medical research—interventions</strong>. This included a discussion of how a seemingly crazy idea by a <em>Colombian doctor</em> running an under-resourced facility changed the way medical professionals work with newborns needing incubators. This technique was called <em>Kangaroo Mother Care</em> since it utilized the body heat of the mothers themselves. <em>Dr.&nbsp;Bahl’s</em> unique expertise on the subject of post-research interventions made the talk engaging.</p>
<p>The session ended with several thought-provoking questions posed by attentive members of the audience, the answers to which were the cherry on top of the lecture series.</p>
<p>As the event concluded, the audience was left wanting for more such lectures in the future as part of the coming editions of <strong>Integration</strong>.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed reading about the event as much as we enjoyed hosting it. Stay tuned for future updates on <strong>Integration 2024</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Auf wiedersehen!</strong></p>
