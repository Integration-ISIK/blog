    "text": "Hey Integration! Shambo here.\nIntegration started off with a bang on the 20th of January with the first edition of the Prof. Saurabh Ghosh Memorial Lecture Series in 2024, honoring the legacy of our very own Sauda.\nSaurabh Ghosh, who was popularly known as Sauda among students and staff, worked as a professor in the Human Genetics Unit at ISI. He specialized in General Epidemiology and was appointed as the Dean of Studies of ISI in 2022, just a few weeks before his unfortunate demise on October 3rd, 2022. His sudden death left a profound void in the hearts of his students and colleagues. To commemorate his memory, the Sauda Memorial lecture series was initiated in 2023 as a significant part of Integration.\nThis time around, we were honored to host Dr. Viswanathan Mohan, an internationally acclaimed diabetologist and Chairman of the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation and Dr. Mohan’s Diabetes Specialities Centre, Chennai, as well as the esteemed Dr. Rajiv Bahl, Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research.\nThis edition of the lecture series started off with a brilliant introduction to the speakers by Prof. Partha P. Majumdar, a close colleague of Sauda, who introduced us to his work with both MDRF and the ICMR.\nThe first lecture started with a captivating presentation by Dr. V. Mohan on what is known as the “diabetes epidemic in India.” Dr. Mohan spent much of his life carrying out foundational research in the field, crafting solutions, and carrying out people-oriented experiments to get to the root of the issue. He had several success stories to present, including the stories of the ASIAD colony and T Nagar in Chennai, as well as the village of Chunampet, all presented in his unique, witty way of storytelling. (Including a little anecdote about how a philanthropic zamindar got involved with the ISRO!) The presentation included a unique blend of statistical work and fieldwork, which enchanted the audience.\nThe second lecture was also unique in its own right, as Dr. Rajiv Bahl set the stage with a series of stories surrounding the most interesting outcome of medical research—interventions. This included a discussion of how a seemingly crazy idea by a Colombian doctor running an under-resourced facility changed the way medical professionals work with newborns needing incubators. This technique was called Kangaroo Mother Care since it utilized the body heat of the mothers themselves. Dr. Bahl’s unique expertise on the subject of post-research interventions made the talk engaging.\nThe session ended with several thought-provoking questions posed by attentive members of the audience, the answers to which were the cherry on top of the lecture series.\nAs the event concluded, the audience was left wanting for more such lectures in the future as part of the coming editions of Integration.\nI hope you enjoyed reading about the event as much as we enjoyed hosting it. Stay tuned for future updates on Integration 2024!\nAuf wiedersehen!"
