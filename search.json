    "text": "Test post with latex.\nThe objective of this section is to study the sum of \\(k\\)th powers of first \\(n\\) natural numbers, that is, the sum \\(S_k(n) = 1^k + 2^k + 3^k + \\ldots + (n-1)^k + n^k\\). Clearly, \\(S_k(n) - S_k(n-1) = n^k\\). So by the method of finite differences, but applied in reverse, we can see that \\(S_k(n)\\) must be a \\((k+1)\\) degree polynomial in \\(n\\). But what polynomial is it? Sadly, the exact expression for general \\(k\\) is not very easy to compute, but we will present a general method. For \\(k = 1\\) it is the sum of an AP, so pairing terms from the beginning and end works, but this doesn’t work for general \\(k\\). Instead, we will use the Binomial Theorem to get that \\((k+1)\\) degree polynomial:\\[(n+1)^{k+1} - n^{k+1} = \\binom{k+1}{1}n^k + \\binom{k+1}{2}n^{k-1} + \\ldots + \\binom{k+1}{k+1}\\]\\[n^{k+1} - (n-1)^{k+1} = \\binom{k+1}{1}(n-1)^k + \\binom{k+1}{2}(n-1)^{k-1} + \\ldots + \\binom{k+1}{k+1}\\]\\[\\cdots\\]\\[\\bigoplus \\qquad 2^{k+1} - 1^{k+1} = \\binom{k+1}{1} + \\binom{k+1}{2} + \\ldots + \\binom{k+1}{k+1}\\]\n\\[\\implies (n+1)^{k+1} - 1 = \\binom{k+1}{1} (1^k + 2^k + \\ldots + n^k) + \\binom{k+1}{2} (1^{k-1} + 2^{k-1} + \\ldots + n^{k-1}) + \\ldots + \\binom{k+1}{k+1} (1 + 1 + \\ldots + 1)\\]Note how this resembles the strong form of induction. The base case \\(S_0(n) = 1 + 1 + \\ldots + 1 = n\\) is known, and to find out \\(S_k\\), you need to know \\(S_0(n), S_1(n) \\ldots S_{k-1}(n)\\). Let us look at some small values of \\(k\\). For \\(k = 1\\):\\[(n+1)^2 - 1 = 2S_1(n) + S_0(n) \\implies n^2 + 2n = 2S_1 + n \\implies \\boxed{S_1 = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}\\]exactly what we got from AP. Now, for \\(k = 2\\), (here onwards \\(S_k\\) means \\(S_k(n)\\) since we are not varying \\(n\\)):\\[(n+1)^3 - 1 = 3S_2 + 3S_1 + S_0 \\implies n^3 + 3n^2 + \\cancel{3n} \\text{   } 2n = 3S_2 + 3\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \\cancel{n} \\]\\[\\implies n(n+1)(n+2) - 3\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 3S_2 \\implies \\boxed{S_2 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}}\\]Note that each of these formulas can be verified by induction very easily.\nSuppose we want to find the sum \\(S\\) of the AGP \\((a+(n-1)d)r^{n-1}\\). We write: \\(\\displaystyle{1S = a + (a+d)r + (a+2d)r^2 + (a+3d)r^3+ \\ldots + (a+(n-1)d)r^{n-1}}\\) \\(\\displaystyle{rS = 0 + (a+0)r + (a+1d)r^2 + (a+2d)r^3 + \\ldots + (a+(n-2)d)r^{n-1}+ (a+(n-1)d)r^n}\\)\nSubtracting the two equations like in case of GP, we get: \\[(1-r)S = a - (a+(n-1)d)r^{n-1} + (dr + dr^2 + dr^3 + \\ldots + dr^{n-1}) = a - (a+(n-1)d)r^{n-1} + dr\\frac{(1-r^{n-1})}{1-r}\\]If the coefficients of \\(r^n\\) are in \\(k\\)th order AP, we simply have to repeat this process \\(k\\) times to bring down the degree of the coefficients to \\(0\\), at which point it becomes the usual GP"
