    "text": "Hey Integration! Rupsa here,\nAfter the massive success of Band-e-Thlon, the cultural chapter of Integration was ready to grace the stage for its singing competition; Alaap.\nThis year, the prestigious singing competition was truly a celebration of music as we paid tribute to the musical maestro Padma Shri Late Ustad Rashid Khan. It was a two-day event filled with beautiful melodies and soulful performances. The Prelims were held on the 3rd of February and the Finals on the 4th.\nRenowned Nazrulgeeti artist Shrimati Monali Mitra Paladhi and Times of India’s best male vocalist for Kishore Kumar award recipient Shri Surankan Bhowmick had graced the event by being present as judges for the prelims.\nWe also had the honor to have Shri Supriya Das Bala, a known face in social media and television as our percussionist to support our participants.\nThe event started with a brief speech on Ustad Rashid Khan, his life, works and musical expeditions, followed by a 1-minute silence condoling his tragic demise.\nIt was finally time for the main event to begin!\nOne of the most captivating aspects of this event was the sheer diversity of performances. More than 50 enthusiastic participants from various colleges performed solo and duet renditions of songs spanning a variety of genres of classical, and Bollywood songs, Rabindra Sangeet, and Nazrul Geeti and set the stage on fire with their eclectic tastes and talents.\nAs the performances came to an end, the top 20 performers were selected to compete for the Finals.\nOn 4th February, the 20 finalists were ready to rock the stage. Kajal Sengupta, the honorary secretary of “Sarbabharatiya Sangeet o Sankriti Parishad” and Snighdadeb Sengupta, recipient of Radio Mirchi Music Award Bangla best male vocalist 2016, honoured the event with their august presence as judges for the performances of the finalists. The event began with another speech on Late Ustad Rashid Khan’s life, after which began the final performances to achieve the coveted spots in the top five. As the final notes faded into the air, the judges retreated to deliberate, faced with the daunting task of selecting the winners from a pool of exceptional talent. Each participant, regardless of the outcome, was applauded for their talent and dedication. Finally, winners are announced, amidst cheers and applause, a testament to the spirit of camaraderie that defines college fests. Rishiraj Baul won the competition with his flawless rendition of Raga Jog. Ahana Nandy, Aishik Bhattacharya, Debayani Sinha Ray, and Swagnik Sinha Roy were the other top 5 winners in that order. The winners were awarded cash prizes from a prize pool of Rs 5000 along with rank certificates. All 20 finalists were given finalist certificates.\nAs this year’s edition of Alaap concluded, it left behind a legacy of harmony, resonating in the memories of those who witnessed its magic. It serves as a testament to the power of music to transcend barriers, unite hearts, and create everlasting bonds. I hope you enjoyed reading about this event as much as we enjoyed hosting it. Stay tuned for more exciting Integration events in the future!\nAu revoir."

    "text": "Hey Integration! Shambo here.\nIntegration started off with a bang on the 20th of January with the first edition of the Prof. Saurabh Ghosh Memorial Lecture Series in 2024, honoring the legacy of our very own Sauda.\nSaurabh Ghosh, who was popularly known as Sauda among students and staff, worked as a professor in the Human Genetics Unit at ISI. He specialized in General Epidemiology and was appointed as the Dean of Studies of ISI in 2022, just a few weeks before his unfortunate demise on October 3rd, 2022. His sudden death left a profound void in the hearts of his students and colleagues. To commemorate his memory, the Sauda Memorial lecture series was initiated in 2023 as a significant part of Integration.\nThis time around, we were honored to host Dr. Viswanathan Mohan, an internationally acclaimed diabetologist and Chairman of the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation and Dr. Mohan’s Diabetes Specialities Centre, Chennai, as well as the esteemed Dr. Rajiv Bahl, Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research.\nThis edition of the lecture series started off with a brilliant introduction to the speakers by Prof. Partha P. Majumdar, a close colleague of Sauda, who introduced us to his work with both MDRF and the ICMR.\nThe first lecture started with a captivating presentation by Dr. V. Mohan on what is known as the “diabetes epidemic in India.” Dr. Mohan spent much of his life carrying out foundational research in the field, crafting solutions, and carrying out people-oriented experiments to get to the root of the issue. He had several success stories to present, including the stories of the ASIAD colony and T Nagar in Chennai, as well as the village of Chunampet, all presented in his unique, witty way of storytelling. (Including a little anecdote about how a philanthropic zamindar got involved with the ISRO!) The presentation included a unique blend of statistical work and fieldwork, which enchanted the audience.\nThe second lecture was also unique in its own right, as Dr. Rajiv Bahl set the stage with a series of stories surrounding the most interesting outcome of medical research—interventions. This included a discussion of how a seemingly crazy idea by a Colombian doctor running an under-resourced facility changed the way medical professionals work with newborns needing incubators. This technique was called Kangaroo Mother Care since it utilized the body heat of the mothers themselves. Dr. Bahl’s unique expertise on the subject of post-research interventions made the talk engaging.\nThe session ended with several thought-provoking questions posed by attentive members of the audience, the answers to which were the cherry on top of the lecture series.\nAs the event concluded, the audience was left wanting for more such lectures in the future as part of the coming editions of Integration.\nI hope you enjoyed reading about the event as much as we enjoyed hosting it. Stay tuned for future updates on Integration 2024!\nAuf wiedersehen!"
